# Frontend

This is where all of the magic happens.

## Changing the HTML

## Changing the style

## Changing the JavaScript
One of the first things you'll notice is the very weird and ugly-looking JavaScript files. These should **never** be changed,
as they are automatically compiled using the node package manager and its compiler. For development, we use Angular 4. The choice
for Angular wasn't so much in that we needed all the functionality, but rather its ease of use and accessible API.
